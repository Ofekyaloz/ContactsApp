# ContactsApp
This Android application allows users to manage their contacts seamlessly. Users can register, log in, and add contacts with their name and phone number. 
Additionally, users have the option to include their contact's birthday and gender. 
If the gender is not specified, the app fetches the information from an external API and sets it automatically.
Moreover, the app provides settings that allow users to customize their contact list by choosing to hide name, number, gender, or birthday fields.
